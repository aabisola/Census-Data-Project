Project Background Information. 
Every ten years, the United Kingdom undertakes a census of the population, with the most recent one 
having been conducted in 2021. The purpose of such a census is to compare different people across the 
nation and to provide the government with accurate statistics of the population to enable better 
planning, to develop policies, and to allocate certain funding.  
 
In the project, you will be provided with a mock census of an imaginary modest town. I would like you 
to consider yourselves to be part of a local government team who will be making decisions on what to 
do with an unoccupied plot of land and what to invest in. To address these questions, you will need to 
clean and analyse the mock census data provided.
